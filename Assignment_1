/* Essentially what I am going for to model the bag of marbles is creating an 
array to represent the bag, which we can pull pieces at random out of. Also 
I would like to create a class to represent the marble with different methods
specifically for that marble class in the case that we might add more bags 
or maybe a bag of dice instead*/

#include <iostream>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

class marble { //helps us create an instance of a marble?
    int value;

    public:
        grab_marble(int colors[]) { //grabs random marble from the bag
            value = rand.colors[].pop;
        }

        add_marble() { //adds marble to bag of specific color stored as a char
            return value;
        
        }
};


int main() {

    char colors[25] //bag only holds 25 marbles


}

/* This still does not run and I have tried a couple different things, but 
unfortunately I think I ran out of time to implement it in a way that it 
would run. Hopefully you can see from this start that I would begin by
creating a merble class and then allow a driver dile to add any number of
different color marbles to a bad and then with the grab_marble method,
randomly select one from the bag. I am still working on learning to code
in c++ to get this done. Also, a lot of this foundation comes from code 
shown in the node class session.*/
